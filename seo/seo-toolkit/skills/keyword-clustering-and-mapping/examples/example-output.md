## Page-Map Decisions

### Mortgage Broker Melbourne (Cluster 0) → `/melbourne`
**Confidence:** 0.82 (Strong)
Page directly targets "mortgage broker melbourne" as H1 and primary keyword. Covers 38 keywords, 41,200 total volume. Action: Review content depth — 6 child suburb keywords (e.g. "mortgage broker south yarra", "mortgage broker richmond") would benefit from suburb-specific sub-sections or dedicated pages (see Cluster 13).

### First Home Buyer Loans (Cluster 1) → GAP
No existing page covers this 29-keyword, 12,800 volume cluster. Top keyword: "first home buyer loan australia" (4,000 vol, KD 58). Recommended format: long-form guide (2,500+ words) covering FHLDS, deposit requirements, and the loan application process.

### First Home Buyer Grants VIC (Cluster 2) → GAP
High-priority gap. 18 keywords, 14,200 total volume, average KD 22 (Easy band). Top keyword: "first home buyer grants victoria 2026" (1,400 vol). Recommended format: evergreen guide with annual update cadence. Strong featured snippet opportunity — question-and-answer structure recommended.

### Refinance Home Loan (Cluster 3) → `/refinance`
**Confidence:** 0.51 (Weak)
Page exists but thin content (estimated 620 words). Cluster has 22 keywords and 18,400 total volume — this is the highest-volume cluster with a weak match. Priority optimisation target. Recommended: expand to 2,000+ words covering "should I refinance", "cash out refinance", and "refinance calculator" use cases.

### What Does a Mortgage Broker Do (Cluster 9) → `/about`
**Confidence:** 0.44 (Weak)
About page incidentally covers these informational queries but lacks the depth needed to rank. Cannibalisation risk: `/guides/mortgage-broker-vs-bank` also ranks for the head term. Recommended: create a standalone `/what-is-a-mortgage-broker` guide; update `/about` to link to it.

## Package Recommendations

_(Incorporated from `recommendations.md`)_

- Cluster quality score (silhouette): 0.58 — acceptable for 347 keywords. Consider re-running with `hdbscan` if you want to identify natural cluster boundaries without forcing 14 groups.
- Cluster 13 (Local Melbourne Suburbs) is oversized at 41 keywords with low centroid cohesion (0.31 average similarity). Consider splitting into 5–10 individual suburb location clusters in a follow-up run.
- 8 keywords were assigned to noise (outlier cluster -1 equivalent in kmeans): "mortgage calculator app", "home loan emoji", "what is a bank" — these are off-topic and should be excluded from content planning.
